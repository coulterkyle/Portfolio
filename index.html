            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Kyle Coulter. I am currently 34 years old and 
            reside in Charlotte, NC. I am currently taking the UNCC Coding Bootcamp
            in an effort to change careers and break into the tech sector. Formerly,
            I worked in the automotive repair industry for 16 years, and even a little 
            more than that, if you count the years I worked in high school. My most recent 
            position was Service Director at McLaren Charlotte. While it was a privledge to drive and 
            service some of the fastest and most expensive cars on the planet - im ready for something new! 
            This is an exciting new challenge and, I hope, the beginning of a promising new career.
            </p>
